Wine Quality Prediction

This model predicts the quality of wine based on the following features:

pH,
fixed Acidity,
volatile acidity,
citric acid,
residual sugar,
chlorides,
free sulphur dioxide,
total sulphur dioxide,
density,
sulphates,
alcohol.

Algorithms Used
Support Vector Classifier: ----> Accuracy: 87%
Random Forest Classifier: ----> Accuracy: 88%
This algorithms will predict the quality of wine.

Model Creation

I have deployed this model locally with the help of flask environment. The result is as follows.

The homepage will input the data from the user and will display the result.
